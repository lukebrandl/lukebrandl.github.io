project: EECS 592 Replication Project

description: This is a project that I completed for EECS 592 Advanced Artificial Intelligence at the University of Michigan in 2016. My goal was to replicate results from the paper "Manifestations of user personality in website choice and behaviour on online social networks" and confirm some unsubstantiated claims. Unfortunately I cannot include the data used in the project due to my agreement with Michal Kosinsky.

files:
    preprocessing.m - Matlab script used to preprocess the data
    processing.m - Matlab script used to finish preprocessing the data for multivariate linear regression and perform said regression analysis.
    replicationreport.pdf - The report I submitted which contains a detailed description of my process and results. Read here for more. I can provide the LaTex file on request.
    other - I definitely wrote a script to compute the SVM with RBF and Poly. kernels, but I cannot seem to find it as I recovered this project from my old computer. Sorry for the omission
